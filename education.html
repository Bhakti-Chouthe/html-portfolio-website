    <b>Anant Bhalerao Vidya Mandir | 2007 – 2019 | 96%</b><br> <br><p> My journey began at Anant Bhalerao Vidya Mandir, where I spent twelve formative years building the foundation of who I am today. This is where I first discovered the joy of learning — in books, classrooms, and curiosity. Every gold star and every question answered made me feel like anything was possible. That 96% wasn’t just a number — it was proof of my love for learning and doing my best, even as a child.</p>

    <b>S.B College | 2020 – 2022 | 86.50%</b> <br> <br> <p>High school at S.B College was when things started to shift. Academics became deeper, choices became real, and dreams took their first proper shape. I explored new subjects, challenged myself, and pushed through uncertainty. Scoring 86.50% during those two years reflected not only my academic effort but also the discipline and growth I nurtured during this phase of becoming.</p>

    <b>Vasantrao Naik Mahavidyalaya | 2022 –  2025 | CGPA - 7.82 </b> <br><br><p> College has been the beginning of my transformation. At Vasantrao Naik Mahavidyalaya, I began connecting the dots — between what I know and what I want to build. Every presentation, team project, and deadline has helped me grow both personally and professionally. These years are not just about grades — they’re about gaining the confidence to step into the world and create a space for myself, one skill and one experience at a time.</p>
